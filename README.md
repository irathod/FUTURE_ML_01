📊 Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This project was built as part of my Machine Learning Internship with Future Interns. The goal was to forecast retail sales using the Superstore dataset and build an interactive dashboard in Power BI for business insights.

🚀 Project Overview

Built a time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet

Cleaned and pre-processed sales data (superstore_clean.csv)

Generated forecast results and exported processed insights (top_products.csv)

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard (task 1.pbix) for business intelligence

Evaluated performance with standard error metrics

📂 Features

✅ Forecasting future sales with Prophet
✅ Actual vs Forecasted sales visualization
✅ KPI Cards: Total Sales, Forecasted Sales, MAE, RMSE, MAPE
✅ Category, Region, and Segment level insights
✅ Top 10 products by sales analysis
✅ Confidence interval visualization for forecasts

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, Prophet, NumPy, Matplotlib

Power BI: Interactive Dashboard, KPI Cards, Filters & Slicers

📈 Model Performance

Error metrics calculated (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) for evaluating forecast accuracy.
(You can run prophet_model.ipynb to reproduce results — update with actual values here if available.)
